# Experimentation Process

## For Uncertain Features

When working on features that have uncertain outcomes or requirements, follow this structured approach:

1. **Create Experiment Branch**
   - Branch naming convention: `experiment/feature-name`
   - Keep the branch focused on one specific experiment

2. **Implement Minimal Viable Version**
   - Focus on core functionality only
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Document assumptions and decisions

3. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Run all automated tests
   - Perform manual testing
   - Gather feedback from team members
   - Document any issues or concerns

4. **Evaluation & Decision**
   - If the experiment is successful:
     - Merge to main branch
     - Document successful outcomes
     - Plan for any necessary refinements
   
   - If the experiment is not successful:
     - Document key learnings and insights
     - Record what didn't work and why
     - Delete the experiment branch
     - Share learnings with the team

## Best Practices

- Keep experiments small and focused
- Set clear success criteria before starting
- Time-box experiments to avoid scope creep
- Document everything for future reference
- Share learnings with the team regardless of outcome
