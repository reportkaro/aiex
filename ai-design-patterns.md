# AI Design Patterns Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates and implements various AI design patterns and best practices, focusing on creating a robust and maintainable codebase with modern development practices.

## Key Components
- Next.js application with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Git hooks for automated testing
- Comprehensive documentation structure
- Experimentation workflow for uncertain features

## Project Structure
- `/src` - Source code
- `/docs` - Documentation
  - `status.md` - Project progress tracking
  - `technical.md` - Technical decisions and patterns
  - `image-optimization.md` - Image optimization guidelines
- `/public` - Static assets
- `.git/hooks` - Git hooks for automated testing

## Development Guidelines
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Keep code modular and reusable
- Run tests before each commit (enforced by Git hooks)
- Follow deployment checklist for all releases
- Use experimentation process for uncertain features

## Recent Updates
- Added Git hooks for automated testing and linting
- Implemented deployment checklist with browser testing and environment checks
- Created experimentation process documentation for handling uncertain features
- Established documentation structure with project context, status, and technical details
- Set up automated pre-commit checks for code quality

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement core AI patterns
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Document technical decisions as they are made
- [ ] Set up monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

## Quality Assurance
- Automated testing through Git hooks
- Browser compatibility testing
- Responsive design verification
- Environment variable management
- Code review process
