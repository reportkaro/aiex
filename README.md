This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Image Optimization

This project includes automatic image optimization for better performance. Images are automatically processed during the build phase to ensure optimal delivery.

### Image Formats

For best performance, use the following formats when adding new images:

| Use Case | Recommended Format | Benefits |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Photos, Illustrations | `.webp` | 25-35% smaller than JPEG, supports transparency |
| Icons, Logos | `.webp` | Small file size, supports transparency |
| Animated Content | `.webm` | Better compression than GIF, smoother playback |
| Hero Images | `.avif` | Best compression, highest quality |
| Images with Transparency | `.webp` | Supports alpha channel, smaller than PNG |

### Image Optimization Script

The project includes an automatic image optimization script that:
- Resizes large images to a maximum width of 1920px
- Generates WebP and AVIF versions for better browser support
- Converts large GIFs to WebM and MP4 formats
- Compresses images while maintaining quality
- Preserves original files as fallbacks

To run the optimization manually:
```bash
npm run optimize-images
```

### Image Directory Structure

Images are organized in the following structure:
```
public/
  images/
    examples/     # Example images and demos
    placeholders/ # Placeholder images
    categories/   # Category-specific images
```

### Best Practices

1. **Image Sizes**:
   - Keep original images under 1920px width
   - Use appropriate compression (80% quality is default)
   - Consider using responsive images for different screen sizes

2. **Adding New Images**:
   - Place images in the appropriate subdirectory
   - Use WebP format for static images
   - Use WebM for animations
   - The build process will automatically optimize them

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals
   - Check image loading performance in Lighthouse
   - Use Next.js Analytics for real-world performance data

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
