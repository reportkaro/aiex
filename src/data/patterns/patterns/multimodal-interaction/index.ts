    problem: "Single-mode interfaces limit user expression and accessibility. Users have different preferences, contexts, and abilities that require flexible interaction methods. Traditional interfaces often force users to adapt to the technology rather than allowing natural communication.",
    solution: "Design interfaces that seamlessly integrate multiple interaction modes, allowing users to switch between or combine voice commands, touch gestures, text input, visual cues, and other modalities based on their context, preferences, and abilities. The system should intelligently interpret and respond through the most appropriate output channels.",

    guidelines: [
      "Design for input mode switching - allow users to seamlessly transition between voice, touch, keyboard, and other input methods",
      "Provide appropriate feedback for each interaction mode (visual confirmation for voice commands, haptic feedback for touch)",
      "Ensure accessibility by offering alternative interaction methods for users with different abilities",
      "Use contextual awareness to suggest the most appropriate interaction mode for the current situation",
      "Design consistent interaction patterns across all modalities while respecting the unique strengths of each",
      "Provide clear affordances that communicate available interaction methods to users",
      "Handle ambiguity gracefully when multiple input modes could be interpreted differently",
      "Support simultaneous multimodal input when it enhances the user experience",
      "Optimize for the primary use case while maintaining secondary mode functionality",
