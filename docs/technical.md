# Technical Documentation

## Design Patterns

### AI Patterns
- Pattern 1: [To be implemented]
- Pattern 2: [To be implemented]

### Development Patterns
1. **Git Hooks Pattern**
   - Implementation: Pre-commit hooks for automated testing
   - Purpose: Ensure code quality before commits
   - Status: Implemented
   - Location: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

2. **Documentation Pattern**
   - Implementation: Structured documentation system
   - Components:
     - Project context (`ai-design-patterns.md`)
     - Status tracking (`docs/status.md`)
     - Technical decisions (`docs/technical.md`)
   - Status: Implemented

3. **Deployment Pattern**
   - Implementation: Comprehensive checklist
   - Components:
     - Local testing
     - Browser compatibility
     - Responsive design
     - Environment variables
   - Status: Implemented

4. **Experimentation Pattern**
   - Implementation: Structured approach for uncertain features
   - Process:
     - Create experiment branch
     - Implement MVP
     - Test thoroughly
     - Evaluate and decide
   - Status: Implemented

## Architecture Decisions

### Current Decisions
1. **Next.js Framework**
   - Reason: Provides excellent TypeScript support and server-side rendering
   - Impact: Enables better SEO and performance
   - Status: Implemented

2. **TypeScript Implementation**
   - Reason: Type safety and better developer experience
   - Impact: Reduced runtime errors and improved maintainability
   - Status: Implemented

3. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Reason: Utility-first approach for rapid development
   - Impact: Consistent styling and reduced CSS maintenance
   - Status: Implemented

4. **Git Hooks Integration**
   - Reason: Automated quality assurance
   - Impact: Consistent code quality and testing
   - Status: Implemented

5. **Documentation Structure**
   - Reason: Maintainable and accessible project knowledge
   - Impact: Better onboarding and decision tracking
   - Status: Implemented

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Set up monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Enhance test coverage
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring

## Performance Considerations
- Image optimization strategy
- Code splitting approach
- Caching mechanisms
- Bundle size optimization
- Server-side rendering optimization

## Security Measures
- Input validation
- API security
- Data protection
- Environment variable management
- Secure deployment practices

## Quality Assurance
- Automated testing through Git hooks
- Browser compatibility testing
- Responsive design verification
- Code review process
- Documentation maintenance

## Notes
- Document all significant technical decisions here
- Include reasoning and alternatives considered
- Update when patterns or decisions change
- Keep track of technical debt
- Monitor performance metrics
